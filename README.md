# 🎪 The Playground HQ

---

## 🎯 Welcome!

You've been hired as an analyst to help design a new community playground. But here's the challenge: you've received a mysterious data file with cryptic codes that only you can see. 

**Your mission:**
1. 🔍 **Decode** your data (turn DATA into INFORMATION)
2. 🤝 **Collaborate** with classmates to find patterns (turn INFORMATION into KNOWLEDGE)
3. 💡 **Decide** on the best playground design (turn KNOWLEDGE into WISDOM)

**The catch:** You cannot solve this alone. You'll need to work with others who have different pieces of the puzzle.

## 📚 What You'll Learn

By the end of this exercise, you'll understand **Ackoff's Hierarchy of Knowledge**:

```
DATA ──────> INFORMATION ──────> KNOWLEDGE ──────> WISDOM
(raw facts)  (organized data)    (patterns & relationships)  (actionable decisions)
```

Plus, you'll practice:
- GitHub collaboration (Issues, Discussions, Markdown)
- Cross-functional teamwork
- Evidence-based decision making

## ⏱️ Time Required

- **Phase 1:** 20 minutes (individual work)
- **Phase 2:** 30 minutes (team collaboration)
- **Phase 3:** 25 minutes (class decision)
- **Total:** ~75 minutes

## 📋 Quick Start Guide

### Phase 1: Decode Your Data (20 mins) ⏰

**Work alone in YOUR repository**

1. Open your assigned data file in the `data/` folder
2. Read it carefully - what patterns do you see?
3. Re-create this using the lego bricks you have been given.
4. Create a new file: `structures/student_XX_structure.md`
5. Use the template below to describe what you found
6. Take a picture of your structure and insert it into the file.

**Template:**
```markdown
# My Structure - Student XX

## What I See in My Data
[Describe the codes, letters, numbers]

## What I Think This Means
[Interpret the patterns]

## What This Could Be
[Your best guess - playground equipment?]

## Questions I Have
[What don't you know yet?]
```

5. Commit your file with message: "Added my structure description"
   
7. **Share your work in Playground HQ:**
   - Open your structure file in your repo
   - Copy the URL from your browser address bar
   - Go to Playground HQ → Discussions
   - Find the pinned thread: "📝 Phase 1: Share Your Structure Links"
   - Comment with your link and a one-sentence summary:
   ```
   **Student XX - Structure Complete!**
   Link: [paste your URL here]
   Summary: [one sentence describing your structure]
   ```
✅ **Done!** You've turned DATA into INFORMATION.

### Phase 2: Find Your Team (30 mins) ⏰

**Collaborate in Playground HQ**

1. Go to **Playground HQ** (link above)
2. Click on **Discussions** → "📝 Phase 1: Share Your Structure Links"
3. Read other students' structure descriptions by clicking their links
4. Look for patterns:
   - Similar heights? (tall vs. ground-level)
   - Similar functions? (climbing vs. balancing vs. resting)
   - Similar energy? (active vs. quiet play)

4. Use **Issues** or **Discussions** to find teammates:
   ```
   Title: Student XX - I have [your structure]!
   
   Looking for others with:
   - [Pattern 1]
   - [Pattern 2]
   
   @student_YY - Your structure looks related!
   ```

5. Form a team of 3-6 people around a common theme

6. Create a **Team Discovery Document** in Playground HQ:
   - Go to Playground HQ repository
   - Navigate to `team-discoveries/` folder
   - Click "Add file" → "Create new file"
   - Name it: `team_X_discovery.md` (choose a team letter/number)
   - Use the template provided in HQ
   - Team members collaborate by editing and commenting
   - Commit when complete: "Team X discovery document"

✅ **Done!** You've created KNOWLEDGE through collaboration.

## 💡 Tips for Success

### Phase 1 Tips
- 🤔 Don't worry if your data seems weird - everyone's does!
- 📝 Describe what you ACTUALLY see, not what you think it "should" be
- ❓ Write down what you DON'T know - this is important!
- 🎨 Feel free to draw your structure with ASCII art

### Phase 2 Tips
- 👀 Read at least 10 other structures before deciding on teammates
- 💬 Use @mentions to tag people when commenting
- 🤝 Be open to different interpretations - there's no single "right" answer
- 📊 Look for structures with similar TYPE, HEIGHT, or COLOR tags
